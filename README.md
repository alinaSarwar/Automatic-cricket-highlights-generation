# Automatic-cricket-highlights-generation

Cricket is the second most watched sports game in the world. It is no surprise that many people, despite being cricket lovers, are unable to keep up with the live matches because of their busy routines and prefer to watch the highlights instead. However, even the shortest format of cricket i.e. T20, tends to have ~3-4 hours long matches, on average. This means that manually producing highlights for such games is a time-consuming and cumbersome task. An efficient method for generating these highlights automatically would not only save manpower but also make sure that the highlights become available for the viewers to watch quickly after the match ends. 
In this project, we aim to implement an approach introduced in a recent [paper](https://www.ijitee.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i11/J11180881019.pdf) by Agarwal et al  for automatically generating cricket highlights. The proposed method reformulates the problem of generating cricket highlights as simply annotating each and every ball of the game in terms of whether an important event (eg. a four, a six, a fall of wicket etc) occurred during that ball. It works by segmenting a full match video into individual ball clips using a self-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect the start of the ball and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for detecting the changes in the scorecard and signaling the end of that ball. Once every ball has been tagged as “interesting” enough or not, the process of generating highlights is then as simple as stitching all such relevant ball clips together into a highlights package.
